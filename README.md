Based on scalar diffraction theory, I created a python code that simulates field propagation in an afocal system. I demonstrate a point object illuminated by an on-axis plane wave, followed by the field distribution on the Fourier plane. A hard aperture stop is put at the Fourier plane, and the field continues to propagate to the image plane, forming an Airy disk. By adjusting the aperture size, the Airy disk can be manipulated to become larger or smaller. This is a fascinating application of scalar diffraction theory give us another perspective to evaluate an optical system other than the geometric ray tracing approach. 
The FT_propgation.py is a function. The inputs are the field distribution at the front focal plane of a lens. Output is the field distribution at the back focal plane of the same lens. When using this python function to simulate a optical system, you must make sure all the input and output fields are evaluated at the fornt and back focal plane. It won't work for other conjugate planes. 
the FT_propgation.py input field dimension is used to calculate the output field dimension. So trust the dimension, you don't need to worry about the scaling mess between fourier transformation.
